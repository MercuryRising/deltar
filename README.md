deltar
======

Automatically add and commit changes to any files added to a deltar directory

As you work, deltar will use git to track changes in target directories and subdirectories.

There will be more options later (session mode, turn on, add changes, work, turn off, add changes and push), but for now this is just a test to see how documents change as you work.
